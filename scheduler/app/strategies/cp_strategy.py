# Constraint Programming 
# Takes a more declarative approach by setting out the needments (constraints) the timeline of task schedule needs to meet, 
# enabling a course in systematic programming to eke ever finer appraisals, a notch into conformance.
# Each method has its balances, often poised in a particular fit's training silo. The "best" one highly rehearses the ectype 
# of conditions at an engross, be it continuity, piping to the right-side slab of resource buffers, or yoking between dynamism in plans' need to cement more twin-breaks at stint, or it spindles a hidden margin of wasted room, under a caustic soot of domain.
