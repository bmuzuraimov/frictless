# Project Express Fall 2023

This repository contains the Express.js server for the Fall 2023 project by bmuzuraimov.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom)
- A command-line interface (like Terminal on macOS or Command Prompt/Powershell on Windows)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-express-fall2023-bmuzuraimov.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
   
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-express-fall2023-bmuzuraimov
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

4. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following content:
